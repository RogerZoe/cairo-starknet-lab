# Functions, Traits & Generics 🧩

This folder studies **abstraction mechanisms** in Cairo.

Instead of usage, the focus is on:
- How abstraction affects ownership
- How generics interact with constraints
- Where complexity hides

## What lives here
- Function call semantics
- Trait-based behavior
- Generic type constraints
- Abstraction trade-offs

## Typical questions explored
- How ownership flows through function boundaries
- Trait assumptions and guarantees
- Generic code and hidden risks

## Why this matters
Abstractions make code reusable — and harder to audit.
Understanding their mechanics reduces review blind spots.
