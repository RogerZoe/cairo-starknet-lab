# StarkNet Contracts (Cairo)

This directory contains **learning-focused StarkNet smart contracts written in Cairo**.

The goal is to understand *how things work*, not just to make them work.

Each subfolder explores a specific concept with:
- minimal example contracts
- clear structure
- short documentation explaining the reasoning

---

## Purpose

These contracts are:
- not production-ready
- intentionally small
- designed for learning, auditing intuition, and correctness

They serve as a personal lab for experimenting with StarkNet and Cairo concepts.

---

## Notes

- All contracts target Cairo v1
- Explicitness is preferred over convenience
- Code is written to be easy to reason about and audit
