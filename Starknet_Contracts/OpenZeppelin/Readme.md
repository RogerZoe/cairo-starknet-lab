# OpenZeppelin Cairo Contracts (StarkNet)

This directory contains **examples and documentation** for using  
**OpenZeppelin Cairo components** in StarkNet smart contracts.

The goal is to provide **practical, minimal references** for integrating
standard OpenZeppelin modules correctly in real projects.

## What This Covers

- Using OpenZeppelin Cairo components (ERC20, Ownable, etc.)
- Correct module imports and project structure

- Best practices for StarkNet-compatible contracts

---

## Requirements

- Cairo 1.x
- StarkNet toolchain installed
- OpenZeppelin Cairo contracts added as a dependency

## Notes

- These examples focus on **clarity over completeness**
- Intended for learning, experimentation, and reference
- Not production-audited contracts
