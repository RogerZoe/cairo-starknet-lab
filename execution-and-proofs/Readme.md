This folder explores how Cairo programs execute on StarkNet and what zero-knowledge proofs actually guarantee.

The focus here is not language syntax, but execution semantics:
- what is executed
- where it is executed
- what the proof attests to
- what remains the auditor’s responsibility

Artifacts in this folder document mental model shifts, such as:
- execution vs verification
- correctness of execution vs correctness of logic
- determinism requirements in StarkNet
- limits of proofs as a security mechanism

These notes exist because misunderstandings here lead to false security assumptions.
